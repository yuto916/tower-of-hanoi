# Tower of Hanoi


## Description
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a set of disks of different sizes.<br/>
The goal of the puzzle is to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following these essential rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.

2. A disk can only be moved to the top of another rod if it is smaller than the disk currently on that rod.

3. Disks can be stacked on top of each other on a rod, but the largest disk must always remain at the bottom if it is present.<br/><br/>


## Additional Info
- The puzzle begins with all the disks stacked on the first rod, arranged in decreasing size from bottom to top.<br/>
- The challenge is to move the disks to the third rod, with the help of the second rod, while adhering to the above constraints.<br/>
- The number of moves required to solve the puzzle for n disks is 2^n - 1.<br/>
